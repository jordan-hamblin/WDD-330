Notes

I thought it was kind of funny how halfway through it said don't use any of the stuff you just read haha.

Global variables are normally frowned upon. Is it different in javascript?

What would happen if you used any of th location methods without asking for permission?

I don't really see the point of using workers if we are going to writing code asynchronously. 
Is there a significant difference?

I am having a little bit of a tough time visualizing what a web socket is. To me two people could communicate
in the same way with one server between them. What am I missing?
