Notes

In industry is is better practise to use straight CSS or use something like bootstrap?

Also in industry are most web applications focused on modern browsers or do they still
provide a lot of focus on outdated browsers?

How detailed can the canvas feature be? Would is it limited to basic shapes and lines?

Is there an industry standard between canvas, and svg?

To be honest I was a little confused about how to do the working examples in this reading.
Because the chapters were referencing things that happened in chapters we did not read.
