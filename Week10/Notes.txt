Notes

I have used a little bit of both html built in validation and javascript validation. I have found the built in
validation a lot simpler to use. How common is it to use javascript validation in industry? Does it come down
to personal preference or is there an industry standard?

Along the same lines, in industry if you do use the javascript validation are you using API's or is it
completely custom?

Is Fetch or AJAX used more in modern web development? I am more familiar with Ajax so it would be nice to be
able to keep using that but if Fetch is the way to go I will probably switch.

From the reading it seems like fetch is better at error handling than AJAX as well as interacting with different
functions. Is there any apparent advantage of AJAX over fetch?
