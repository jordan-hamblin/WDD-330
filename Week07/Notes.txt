Notes

How significant is the memory cost for storing the results in cache?
 
Is an IIFE kind of like an onload function but can happen at times different times than when the page is loading?

Are functions that define and reqrite themselves industry approved? That seems kind of dangerous to me.

Pure functions sound pretty good. Is that the way that industry is leaning in JavaScript is OOP still the preferred way?
